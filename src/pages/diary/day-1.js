    <h1>Day 1 â€“ 05/02/2020</h1>
    <p>Today, I began my very exciting journey into the Amazon Rainforest.
    Yesterday I flew from Ireland to Manaus in Brazil on an 11 hour flight.
    I then took a bus to my hotel where I was sleeping at for the night.
    This morning at 9am I was collected at the hotel by my guide Pedro,
    who would be my guide for the next 5 days.</p>

    <p>Pedro took me to the nearby docks where we boarded the riverboat that would
    take us into the rainforest.  We needed to take a boat because the density of the
    forest makes land travel too hard.  There were about 10 other people in my tour group.</p>

    <p>We set off up the Amazon River and I was overwhelmed at the sights and noises as we
    travelled up the river.  We were very lucky to see a Pink River Dolphin on the journey, it was majestic! </p>

    <p>After 3 hours we arrived at our camp for the evening.  It is a wooden lodge with
    fold out beds, but it is still very comfortable.   I am looking forward to starting my adventures tomorrow. </p>
